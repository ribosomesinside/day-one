# 1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility

### Monya Baker

### 25 May 2016

## Survey sheds light on the 'crisis' rocking research.

**More than 70% researchers could not reproduce another scientist's experiments**, and more than half have failed to reproduce their own experiments.\
\

The data reveal sometimes-contradictory attitudes towards reproducibility. Although `52%` of those surveyed agree that there is a significant *crisis* of **reproducibility**, less than `31%` think that failure to reproduce published stuff means that the result is probably wrong [^1] , and most still trust the published literature.

[^1]: As scientists we tend to doubt in our results more.
